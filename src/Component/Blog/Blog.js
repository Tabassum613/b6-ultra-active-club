                    <p>React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory. Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM. React only changes what needs to be changed!

                        3.State can be used only with the state components/class component . <br />

                    <p>If weâ€™re using hooks in React function components, we can load data from an API when the component first loads by using the useEffect hook with an empty array as the second argument.</p>

                    <p><h5><b>front-end</b></h5>
                        ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook. Moreover, React Js makes Front-end development very easy.</p>

                    <p>
                        React is a cool tool for web development, and as cool as it is, it's very easy to learn. Learning it at the right time puts you at a higher advantage. To step up your web development career with React you can learn NextJS or Remix easily.</p>
